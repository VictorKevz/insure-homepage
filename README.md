## Challenge Overview
The challenge is to build out a landing page and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible. The primary focus is on HTML and CSS, with a minimal amount of JavaScript for the mobile navigation toggle. The key objectives are:
- Creating an optimal layout for different device screen sizes
- Implementing hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://victorkevz.github.io/insure-homepage/).

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on all devices.
- **Hover States**: Interactive elements have hover effects that provide visual feedback to users.
- **Focus States**: Interactive elements are accessible and provide clear focus states.
- **Scale Transformation on Hover**: Elements scale smoothly on hover to enhance interactivity.
- **Entry Animation**: Elements animate on entry using Framer Motion, adding a dynamic touch to the page.
- **In-View Animation**: Elements animate while in view using Framer Motion, enhancing user engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
- **CSS3**: The style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations in React.
